<h1>UX Case Study</h1>
   <p>Background: Pan Am is an old American airlines that went out of
business, but now is making a coming back by creating a new modern
web site. Because more and more bookings are being completed
online, Pan Am wants their site design to function across all digital
devices. </p>
 <p>This project required 80 hours.  I conducted research, defined product requirements, explored
  the sites structure, created wireframes, prototypes and tested the final product.  I sought participants who had experience booking airline tickets to gain insight about their experience. These users helped me understand their needs, as well as the pains and frustrations of booking airline tickets so that I could create the best user experience possible, for Pan Am Airlines.
  A combination of primary and secondary research paved the way for the brand new design of Pan Am Airlines first online site.</p>

<p>First I had to create a research plan.  This involved defining research goals, methods of
  research and targeted participants.</p>
   <p><i>Primary Qualitative Research:</i> will be used when I ask open-ended questions that
lead to further insights about user&#39;s travel ticket booking experiences.</p>
    <p><i>Quantitative Research:</i> will help me determine quantifiable data like
users age, gender, which device they use, locations they prefer to
travel</p>
    <p><i>Market Research:</i> can help me determine what competitors are doing
that works and what are modern trends</i>.
  </ul>
<p>After conducting research on participants, and synthesizing the results, I was able to come to
    come to some insights for Pan Am Airlines...</p>

<h2>HMW Questions</h2>
</div>
</div>

<div layout="row">
<div class="padding" flex="50">
<p>These questions help us take user insights and move toward defining product requirements.</p>
<p>HMW 1: How might we build a feature that can quickly
determine and display the cheapest airfare options?</p>
<p>HMW 2: How might we notify users of when they need to
start booking tickets to avoid paying a higher cost?</p>
<p>HMW 3: How might we display trips to European countries
that appeal to users?</p>

</div>

<div class="padding" flex="50">
<p>Solution: Present travel deals on the landing page, or deals page
that allow users to save money on hotel or airfare. These allinclusive
package deals will include sight-seeing, hotel, airfare,
tour-guides or any amenities that users can choose to include,
which will save them money as costs are grouped.<br>
Solution: Present travel deals or coupons to a wide array of
popular European travel destinations like Spain, France, London,
Italy, Germany, Switzerland and more.<br>
Solution: Show beautiful appealing, high-resolution images of
European travel destinations, that excite users, and link to travel
deals.</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>
<b>Usability Test Objectives</b><br>
User can easily navigate through the website<br>
User can search for a flight<br>
User can select a flight<br>
User can view a flight details<br>
User can checkout a flight successfully<br>
User can view other pages; My Travel Planner, Browse Deals and
On Board Experience Page
</div>
<div class="padding" flex="50">
<h2>Summary</h2>
 All of the participants found all of the tasks easy and straightforward. Some
of the participants found the limitations of the prototype confusing and needed
clarification. One user needed help to find the browse deals page, and another felt that it
was hard to find the flights that she should select, which required scrolling down. She
felt this process should be more intuitive or flow more naturally. Most prototypes found
that the prototype was good. Also, all of them thought that the flight details close button
should be at the top of the pop-up because it is easier to notice, and easier and more
natural to have it at the top. Next steps should be to move the flight details close button
to the top and make the search results have a better user flow that is more intuitive and
smoother.</p>
