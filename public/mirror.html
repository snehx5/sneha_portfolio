  <h1 style="text-align:center;">UX Case Study</h1>
  <h3 style="font-size:32px;color:black;">Mirror.com</h3>
  <p>Mirror is a long-time established retailer of family clothing.  It has a style that is
    similar to HM, and Old Navy, carrying clothes for all age groups.  As Mirror desired to
    break into the digital market, the company required a
    modern website design and brand new logo design.  As the designer for this project, I was responsible for creating the best possible user experience and site design for Mirror's customers.  This involved research, understanding the information architecture of the new e-commerce site, encapsulating Mirror's brand identity in the design, designing elements to mold together the user interface, and testing a tentative prototype on potential users.</p>

  <h3>1. Research</h3>
  <p>First I had to create a research plan.  This involved defining research goals, methods of
  research and targeted participants.</p>


    <p><i>Primary Qualitative Research:</i> was used to answer questions about the users'
      opinions and help me get more insight regarding their online shopping experiences</p>
    <p><i>Quantitative Research:</i> was used to make sense of objective data like users'
      demographics and what device they most popularly use.</p>
    <p><i>Quantitative and Market Research</i> determined most popular items of users. I also
      explored competitors to see strengths and weaknesses of similar popular websites.</p>.
     </div>

  <p>After conducting research on particpants, and synthesizing the results, I was able to come to
    come to some major insights for Mirror.com...</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom:20px;"><span style="font-size:20px;"><b>My Plan</b></span><br>Build a website that has solid copy on the landing page, and item
descriptions that attract users searching for clothes online. The site
shows ads, photos of a variety of clothes that are stylish, and of good
quality. Website should take inspiration from JCPenney, H&M, and
Amazon, stores which the users all like. Also, the website will have
some sales and coupons that are not applicable in store. The UI is clean
and efficiently moves the user through to the the shopping section
where they can browse many clothes, and filter these based on size, and
other option filters. There will be a section explaining the clothing
stores system of measurements so that the user can check what size he
or she is. The user can return clothes easily, like Amazon. Overall the
site design is good, and saves the user time, gives them many clothing
options, and makes them feel smart about their money.</p>

<h4>5. Testing</h4>
<div id="assignment">
<p>I conducted usability tests on five people.  Four of these were at Starbucks in the mall.
They were able to provide feedback on the usability of the prototype by completing some tasks.
</p>

<div id="assignment">
  <p>I then used an affinity map to synthesize the research into next steps.</p>
  <img src="images/affinitymap.png" class="img-responsive"/>

</div>
<p id="next"><b>Next Steps:</b> The conclusions from my usability testing and affinity map provide me
    with a good idea of how to continue improving my prototype.
    I moved on to adding a drop-down navigation to the landing page, and changing the call-to-action button to the accent color, green. Below is my final prototype.</p>
